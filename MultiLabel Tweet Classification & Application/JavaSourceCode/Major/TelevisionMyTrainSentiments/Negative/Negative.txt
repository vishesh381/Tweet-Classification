How to connect Sony BRAVIA TV to CPU [ HDMI Cable connection]
 i cry i can't buy a tv sony for my ps4 until my fathers tv broke,  because sony have designed all bravia with the same ir codes
We got a new TV in the livingroom yesterday. Sony Bravia 4K LED 65x850c (tho it can't be connected to DirectTV RVU ... which is troubling) 
 How the hell is this 40" #Samsung #1080p TV only £269?! They'll all be gone in a hour.
you know you failed at life when you're ignored on Skype watching Hentai with 3D surround sound on a 60 inch curved samsung TV one day
 @smperris @jplonie I'd look at Sony for stability. Panasonic isn't supported. LG are good Appletv Telstra TV are good but not all channels
Is this the best TV ever? Panasonic TX-65CZ952 review:

 @PanaService_UK HDMI to a new Panasonic TV and via wifi to the internet (strong signal). It's just a cheaply made piece of shoddy tech.
 @kjhank TV came too late as a target platform. also, panasonic and co have too much legacy invested in their own "app stores" bollocks
@patrick_h_lauke And yet Panasonic's flagship OLED TV comes with their old software, not Firefox OS.
 @panasonic @SonyUK If you are considering the new android 4k TV from @Sony check the sony community forum first. Dont be fooled!
