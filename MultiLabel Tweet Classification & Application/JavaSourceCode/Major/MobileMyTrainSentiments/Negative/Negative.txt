 My device showed 6.0 update notification and now it's gone #motog3 update was around 446 MB @MotorolaIndia
MotorolaIndia deposited motoG3 at srvice cntre for sim tray replacement more than a month ago. No progress #careless_attitude #BAD_SERVICE
 @MotorolaSupport please fix lag which appear while clearing recent apps in recent menu in #MotoG3  in Android 6.0 #Marshmallow  update.
 : @OnePlus_Support @OnePlus_IN after I disconnect wifi, it doesn't reconnect until I restart phone, happens randomly, s/w bug?
 View outside my window. Sad that despite 13MP lens, my MotoG3 can't get the moon right. Unsatisfactory snap.
 #OnePlusTwo finger print scanner and home button failed.
: Want to take a backup of all data on my #oneplustwo and restore it on Samsung galaxy s6 edge @Zollotech

@umairsaeed @patarimusic There is some weird bug on OnePlusTwo. But we are very close to fixing it. Expect it very soon :)
 RT @AndroDollar: Invite System is Dead, at least for the @OnePlus 2! #OnePlusTwo 
@Being_royals :/ What about MotoG3  @divyamisra2
Very disappointing zooming for #motog3 #htc #desirex was 100 times better than this..
 @Motorola having pathetic experience with after sales service. already repenting my decision to go for motorola in 2 months of owning motoG3
 @BeingSuperHero Frankly comparing MotoG3 with MotoXPlay is wrong. Both are different class of devices hence different performance @Motorola
 @Motorola why doesn't #motog3 support #GoogleCardboard app?
@flipkartsupport bought motog3 from u guyz and not even one month completed, speaker stopped working. R u selling defected items?#LostTrust
@amazonIN having issues with the OnePlusTwo which I bought on September 2015 from Amazon.in . Whom to contact for return/replacement/repair?
Quick switch back to iPhone, then I'm going to photograph and auction a jar set on IG. Last tweet from this #oneplustwo.
nePlusTwo cannot load bootloader, cannot access recovery lol. And locked. So I bricked it. Only can access through fastboot. Shiet.
oneplus @OnePlus_IN @OnePlus_Support The glass of my oneplustwo has cracked. How do I fix it?
Sentiment:Negative
